2.2.2
=====

* Fix cleaning of peer dependencies. (Thanks, @BridgeAR!)
* Significantly improve cleanup performance. (Thanks, @BridgeAR!)

2.2.1
=====

* Running `dmn clean` on very large setups could crash. (Thanks, @silverwind,
for reporting!) The problem was in either the very old version of `globby` we
were using or a dependency of it. `globby` is built on top of `fast-glob`. We
weren't using any of the features that `globby` adds to `fast-glob`, so we
switched to `fast-glob` and updated to the latest version. This fixed the
problem.

2.2.0
=====

* Now cleans even more files than before! (Thanks @silverwind!)
* Whoops! Tests weren't actually running previously. Now they are.

2.1.0
=====

* `dmn will now remove .ts (TypeScript) and .map (sourcemap) files.
* .editorconfig enhancements. (thanks @vladimyr!)
* Remove unnecessary proxy launcher. (thanks @vladimyr!)
* markdown fixes in README. (thanks @maxnordlund)

2.0.0
=====

* Support for Node.js 6.x and newer only.
